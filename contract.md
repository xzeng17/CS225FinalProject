# Communication 
1. *Team Meetings* <br>
    Our team will meet once a week every Friday from 7-8 PM using Zoom. 
    Each team meeting will have an assigned note-taker who will be responsible for taking notes in a clear and structured way. The duration of the meetings will be uploaded on a shared Google doc.
2. *Assistance*  <br>
    The preferred place to reach out for assistance is Slack, in which we will post our questions in the channel with the relevant topic that we will be working on. Each team member can also be contacted by university email address ({nb17, xzeng17, xiaojun7, yuesong3}@illinois.edu). Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to reply to communications within 48 hours.
3. *Respect*  <br>
    It is the responsibility of a note-taker for the week to ensure that every member in the group had a chance to speak and present their opinions regarding the tasks for the week. Any decisions regarding the implementation of the tasks will be accepted by simple majority. Each team member commits to providing their ideas or alternative solutions in case they have a disagreement with other team members regarding the tasks. 
    
# Collaboration
1. *Work Distribution* <br>
    During each weekly meeting, all group members are going to decide what we are going to work on during the next week and what deliverables should be achieved before the next meeting. We will write down the deliverables and each of us will pick the one or more with which they prefer to work on. If the team members do not have a preference over deliverables, then the tasks will be assigned randomly. 
2. *Time Commitment* <br>
    At least 2 hours and at most 6 hours per week on writing final project code and updates. If it takes more than 6 hours to work on a particular deliverable, then the other team members should help to complete the task. 
3. *Conflict Resolution* <br>
    In case we have a disagreement or conflict, the issue will be resolved by a collective vote of a group. We need to bring up the issue in the meeting in front of the whole group and present some logical explaination about why we should pick one solution over the other, and all members should vote and decide what is the optimal solution.
