User guide:
1. To compile file:         $ make
2. To compile test case:    $ make test
3. To run the main.cpp:     $ ./main
4. To run all test case:    $ ./test 

Currently implemented:
1. BFS algorithm
2. Generalized Iterator for traversal algorithm
3. CSV file loader and formatting
4. BFS test case

Will build the following API:
1. Modify current buildGraph function to accomodate .txt input file.
2. Implement DFS finding n sized circle
3. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
4. Implement IDDF search
5. Strongly connected component for undirected graph
6. Implement test cases
7. Test Algorithm on both graph type
8. Design flow
9. Implement user Interaction
10. Test flow
11. Demo Video
